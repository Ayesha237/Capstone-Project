# Capstone-Project

In our Capstone Project, we worked with a real dataset from a longevity supplements company. Headquartered in Switzerland, with production and distribution facilites in the UK, this is a relatively new start-up, which has been growing at an exponential rate. It is a B2C company, which is operating completely online, shipping their supplements worldwide.

The company's vision is to focus on creating supplements with high quality ingredients that act in synergy to slow aging at the cellular level, because, as they say, when your cells work better, your whole body works better!

The global longevity market is worth $ 8 trillion and is expected to grow by 45% in the next five years. This field is the future of health care as more and more people are believing that long-term health is an investment and not an expense.

For this project specifically, we took a look at the company's business model and their business development and growth. As this is a relatively new company, we only had two years of data to analyse. However, we were able to find certain interesting anamolies, which we studied further and then shared with our stakeholders.
